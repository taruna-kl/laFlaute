# laFlaute
The end product will be an Android app that can be used to play flute.
I have used 6 vertically placed buttons to play 6 different sounds.When we start playing by clicking the lowermost button 
and reach the top, the sounds are being played correctly.But,after that,all the other buttons except the topmost are not working.
Help me understand the error in the code :)
